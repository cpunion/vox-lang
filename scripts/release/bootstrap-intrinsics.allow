# Reserved intrinsics allowed to be called from src/std while rolling bootstrap
# is pinned by scripts/release/bootstrap.lock.
#
# Additions here should follow the two-phase rollout rule:
# 1) land compiler/runtime support and release it;
# 2) update bootstrap lock;
# 3) then allow std usage by adding to this list.

# empty on purpose:
# src/std should not call reserved `__*` intrinsics directly.
