# Pinned stage2 bootstrap release tag used by release pipeline.
# The release workflow will try to fetch:
#   vox-lang-${STAGE2_BOOTSTRAP_TAG}-<platform>.tar.gz
# and extract bin/vox-stage2[.exe] as rolling bootstrap compiler.
STAGE2_BOOTSTRAP_TAG="v0.1.1"

# When true, if locked bootstrap asset is unavailable, release build falls back
# to stage1 bootstrap so first rollout can still ship.
