# Vox Documentation

This directory now has two tracks:

- `docs/reference/`: user-facing language and tool reference (normative surface docs)
- `docs/internal/`: historical and compiler design/implementation notes

Migration note:

- Existing design/spec documents were moved from `docs/*.md` to `docs/internal/*.md`.
- Ongoing work will publish stable language-facing references under `docs/reference/`.

Quick links:

- `docs/reference/README.md`
- `docs/internal/README.md`
